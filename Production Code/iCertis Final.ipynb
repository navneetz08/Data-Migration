      "a.\tHP appoints Wincor as a System Aggregator (SA) based on HP's approval of Wincor's business plan. \n",
      "\n",
      "b.\tWincor's business plan will contain Wincor's business objectives for the next 12 months relating to the Products, including Wincor's logistics, sales promotion, training and support plans. The business plan must be submitted to HP prior to the anniversary date of this Agreement.\n",

      "2. RELATIONSHIP\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "c.\tUnless otherwise agreed, Wincor will not resell the Products outside Europe, which is defined as the member countries of the European Economic Area (\"EEA\") and the European Free Trade Association (\"EFTA\").

      "\n",
      "4. PRICES AND DISCOUNTS\n",
      "\n",
      "a.\tNet Wincor prices for Products will be HP's local currency list prices in effect on the date Wincor's order is received by HP, less the applicable discount as specified in the attached Exhibits.

      "\n",
      "f.\tWincor may request changes in scheduled delivery dates for the Products appearing on its orders or cancel orders at no charge, provided written notice of said changes or cancellations are received by HP at least 30 days before the scheduled delivery date. Any later changes or cancellations will be subject to a charge equal to 5% of the list price of the Products.\n",
      "\n",
      "g.\tIf Product orders are cancelled after shipment, Wincor will in addition pay transportation and related charges for returning Products to HP's shipping location .\n",
      "\n",
      "6. PRICE PROTECTION ON OPEN ORDERS\n",
      "\n",
      "a.\tIf a list price and/or discount change results in a lower net purchase price for Wincor, HP will invoice Wincor for outstanding orders for Products not yet shipped at the new, lower purchase price.\n",
      "\n",
      "b.\tSection 6a. will not apply when special project discounts have been applied to the outstanding orders.\n",
      "\n",
      "c.\tIf a list price and/or discount change results in a higher net purchase price for Wincor, HP will invoice Wincor for outstanding orders at the old, lower price.\n",
      "\n",
      "d.\tIf a list price change results in a higher net purchase price for Wincor, Wincor may place orders at the old, lower price within 30 days following the effective date of the change. Such orders may not exceed 120% of Wincor's average monthly orders for the Products concerned during the previous 6 months and will be delivered immediately, subject to availability.\n",
      "\n",
      "e.\tThe provisions of Section 6a. and 6c. will not apply to changes in discounts which occur due to the opening of a new ordering period.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. SALES AND SUPPORT STAFF\n",
      "\n",
      "a.\tWincor agrees to maintain per release point of this Agreement at least the number of qualified, trained and HP-certified sales representatives and support employees defined in the attached Exhibits.\n",
      "\n",

If the Agreement requires that specific HP Products must perform as a system in accordance with the foregoing warranty, then that warranty will apply to those HP Products as a system, and Customer retains sole responsibility to ensure the Year 2000 readiness of its information technology and business environment. The duration of this warranty extends through January 31, 2001 or until the expiration date of the standard HP Product warranty included in the purchase price of the Product, whichever is later. To the extent permitted by local law, this warranty applies only to branded HP Products and not to products manufactured by others that may be sold or distributed by HP. This warranty Section, 11 i), applies only to HP Products ordered unter the terms of this OPM. The remedies applicable to this Section, 11 i), are those provided in Section 11 j) below.
